# Verification record

Entries record results and deployment state at the time of each check; historical `latest` digests and local-only status are not statements about the current release.

## September 18 Docker image address update

The requested primary image is now `ghcr.io/addison16/commandtable:latest`. The [migration workflow](https://github.com/Addison16/commanders-table/actions/runs/35336598346) copied the existing v0.2.0 images with all architectures and attestations and required digest preservation. The source release tag and application version are unchanged. The `commanders-table` package remains available; future releases publish version, commit, stable and latest tags to both names.

Anonymous registry reads verified identical old/new `0.2.0` and `stable` indexes (`sha256:aee42c92b869408b53b05eb53be5356d4155b1f01e4077463ad4316bde8ddbe2`) and identical `latest` indexes (`sha256:f1fd2ba7bdeaa6f3d84cffea4d835000ac56b665c986914adf46f006404fe988`). Both architectures, attestations, config hashes, version/source/license labels and embedded licenses were checked. An actual Docker pull without credentials passed, and the new package page's first command uses `commandtable:latest`.

Compose configuration, actionlint, formatting and 15 targeted workflow checks passed, including stable/prerelease tags, release-download retries and fail-closed package refresh cases. Current README/deployment examples, Compose/environment defaults and the v0.2.0 release body/downloads use the new image address. The historical source tag remains intact; the release's installation downloads were refreshed for the address change.

The running service now uses the anonymously pulled `commandtable:latest` image with the existing Compose project, data volume and public origin. A verified database backup, previous image and previous configuration were retained. Exact before/after hashes match all saved server records. The container is healthy, HTTPS requests succeed, and the HTML, service worker, manifest and health response are byte-identical before and after recreation. This is the same already-tested app image; no application or browser-storage changes were introduced.

## September 17 v0.2.0 publication

The user explicitly authorized publication of all current source and Docker improvements as **[Command Table v0.2.0](https://github.com/Addison16/commanders-table/releases/tag/v0.2.0)**, release commit `b04ef2f26ee1f5075723d04971e2f4753998b552`. The release includes the rebrand, fresh-game/rematch flow, automatic mobile layouts, group life effects, commander rulings, recap PNGs, player-status badges and Docker-first hosting instructions. The earlier local-only entries below are historical preview records; these improvements are now published.

[Main CI](https://github.com/Addison16/commanders-table/actions/runs/35300236115) and the [v0.2.0 release workflow](https://github.com/Addison16/commanders-table/actions/runs/35300236450) both completed successfully. Each passed **172 unit/integration checks across ten files**, **129 Chromium/WebKit browser cases with three expected skips**, production PWA prompted-update/offline checks in both engines, HTTPS/WSS proxy checks and native amd64/arm64 container smoke tests.

Local production-Docker coverage separately passed **130 unique browser cases across 19 files with two expected WebKit skips** (132 total). Two test fixtures were corrected: waiting for a durable save before reload, and blocking service workers in contexts that deliberately mock artwork. Corrected artwork and screenshot/layout reruns passed 8/8 and 2/2; no production defect or unresolved browser failure remained. Local lint/types/build, PWA, proxy and LAN checks passed; the LAN expectation now matches fresh four-seat, 40-life rooms. `npm audit` reported zero known vulnerabilities. Compose configurations, actionlint, five mocked release-workflow cases and the candidate x64 container smoke passed.

Anonymous registry checks verified `0.2.0` and `stable` at `sha256:aee42c92b869408b53b05eb53be5356d4155b1f01e4077463ad4316bde8ddbe2`. The dedicated `latest` index is `sha256:f1fd2ba7bdeaa6f3d84cffea4d835000ac56b665c986914adf46f006404fe988`, with identical platform/attestation descriptors and a separate latest annotation. Both amd64 and arm64 images carry the correct Command Table title, version, source revision and `PolyForm-Noncommercial-1.0.0` license label, with embedded licenses matching the source exactly. Historical `0.1.0`, `0.1.1`, `0.1.2`, `0.1.4` and `0.1.5` image digests are unchanged. An actual anonymous Docker pull passed.

The public source ZIP and tar.gz each contain 147 files matching the release commit byte for byte, with no private artifacts. The release's `compose.yaml` and `docker.env.example` downloads match the source exactly. The package landing page's first install command is `docker pull ghcr.io/addison16/commanders-table:latest`.

The anonymously pulled public image passed a separate isolated x64 container smoke test and is deployed as `ghcr.io/addison16/commanders-table:latest` with the existing project, configuration, origin and volume. The verified `before-v020-public-20260917.sqlite` backup was retained in the volume and copied to the host; `command-table:before-v020-public-20260917` and a configuration copy retain the rollback state. Exact before/after hashes match 38 rooms, 62 memberships, 195 events, zero snapshots and 65 session identities/revocation flags; the SQLite schema remains 2. The container is healthy and the HTTPS health endpoint returned 200.

The published frontend was byte-identical to the verified local frontend, so this deployment did not need a new service-worker update prompt. A live browser retained its exact 39-life Mira game with poison 3, damage 7 and tax +2 through online and offline reloads. Offline Undo removed only the damage badge and persisted after another offline reload. The separate production PWA gates verified prompted updates. No physical-phone or native share-sheet validation is implied.

## September 17 local player-status badges

Conditional badges show **CMD MAX** as the highest damage received from one commander, **POISON**, and next-cast **TAX**; partners retain separate **TAX I/II** values. Zero values and disabled trackers stay hidden. Damage and poison warnings follow configured thresholds. The summaries are derived from existing saved values without changing game data.

Lint, types, the production build and **172 unit/integration checks across ten files** pass, along with **ten status-browser cases** and **18 automatic-layout regressions** across Chromium and WebKit. The local image `command-table:local-status-badges` (`3de94b9075de`, version `0.1.5-local.5`) passed isolated x64 container smoke and is deployed with the existing configuration and volume. A verified `before-status-badges-20260917.sqlite` backup was copied to the host, and the previous image/configuration were retained. Exact before/after hashes match 38 rooms, 62 memberships, 195 events, zero snapshots and 65 session identities/revocation flags. Container and HTTPS health checks pass.

A live Chromium browser applied **Save & update** and retained its exact 39-life Mira game, poison 3, one own commander cast and damage 7. The new **7 / 3 / +2** badges survived online and offline reloads. Offline Undo removed only the damage badge; poison, tax and life remained correct through another offline reload. The screenshot was visually inspected. No physical-phone or ARM verification is claimed for this update. Changes remain local and unpublished; public releases remain at v0.1.5.

## September 17 local group life, commander rulings and game recaps

**Utilities → Group life change** requires an explicit caster, initially selects the other active opponents, and lets the table choose a smaller affected group. The entered loss applies to each selected opponent. Optional caster gain is an explicitly entered **total**, never inferred or multiplied by the opponent count. A preview shows every changed total before submission. The command validates participants, duplicates, caster exclusion, active status and numeric bounds before applying the whole effect atomically; one Undo reverses it. In shared rooms only the host can use it, even when everyone may edit numerical trackers.

Group-life submission waits for durable local storage or the room acknowledgement. Stale game/revision previews are rejected. If the result cannot be confirmed, the form explains that the effect may already have applied, disables direct resubmission and requires checking totals/history and clearing the form before another effect. This preserves room operation deduplication and avoids turning an uncertain save into a second life change. Storage-abort browser checks also exposed a sheet-dismissal bug: clicking a global error toast counted as an outside interaction and closed the editor. The sheet now ignores interactions within that toast so dismissing an error retains the open form and draft.

**View commander → Rulings & notes** lazily looks up the selected card UUID, displaying dated Wizards of the Coast rulings or Scryfall notes with attribution. Loading, retry, empty results and additional-rulings links are handled without changing the game. Recently opened rulings can reopen from the current tab's bounded memory cache for up to one hour; reload clears that cache, and uncached lookups require a connection.

**Game menu → Share game recap** creates a PNG with the current or final table's duration, player colors, names, commanders and life totals. Finished-game recaps offer an optional winner or draw selection that affects only the image; active snapshots do not declare a winner. The image can use native file sharing when supported or **Download PNG**, and a text version is available. **View final game** from Home can open the final recap. Exporting or choosing its result does not alter the game.

ESLint, TypeScript, the production build and **165 unit/integration checks across nine files** pass, including nine recap unit cases. All **32 targeted Chromium/WebKit browser cases** pass: ten group-life cases, four existing player-save regressions, 12 commander-reading/rulings cases and six recap cases. The two storage-abort cases passed after the sheet-dismissal fix and verify that closing the error toast retains the editor. Recap checks cover real PNG generation, a mocked native-share API and download fallback, eight players, long text, negative life, offline export, automated accessibility and unchanged game data.

Final production PWA checks pass in both engines after rebuilding with the sheet fix. Group-life acknowledgement-loss cases pass in both engines: after the server commits but its acknowledgement is lost, reconnect resubmits the original operation without applying the effect twice, and the retained form blocks a blind retry.

The final local image `command-table:local-features` (`c40c5f39e162`, version `0.1.5-local.4`) matches the verified production frontend and passed the isolated x64 container smoke test for startup, SQLite, rooms, receipt deduplication, recreation, backup and restore. It is deployed with the same configuration, Compose project and volume. The verified `before-table-features-20260917.sqlite` backup was retained in the volume and copied to the host; `command-table:before-table-features-20260917` retains the previous image, and the prior deployment configuration is backed up. Exact before/after hashes match all 38 rooms, 62 memberships, 195 events, zero snapshots and 65 session identities/revocation flags. The container is healthy and the HTTPS health endpoint returned 200.

A live browser holding the previous service worker applied **Save & update** and retained its exact saved game with Mira, blue, Jace and 39 life. Icon bytes, branding/export names, native rotation and manual layout override also remained correct. Offline, a group effect applied loss 2 to each of the other three players, moving their life from 40 to 38, and changed Mira from 39 to 42 only through an explicit total gain of 3. One Undo restored every original player value.

The deployed card endpoint returned real Jace rulings, which opened without changing the saved game. After ending the browser-local game, **Home → View final game → Share game recap** exported a real 1080-pixel-wide PNG with an explicitly selected Mira win; the ended game remained exactly unchanged. These are browser checks, not physical-phone or native share-sheet validation. All changes remain local and unpublished, alongside the earlier rebrand, automatic-layout and fresh-game/rematch refinements. No commits, tags, releases or Docker images were pushed; public releases remain at v0.1.5.

## September 17 local Command Table rebrand

The requested name **Command Table** now appears in the app header, browser title, PWA manifest names, settings notice, storage/upgrade/import messages and current documentation. New game, match and recovery exports use the `command-table-` filename prefix. Package metadata uses `command-table`; the Docker title, server log, Scryfall User-Agent and future release-title template reflect the new name. Historical release records retain their original branding.

The existing GitHub repository and GHCR image addresses remain `Addison16/commanders-table` and `ghcr.io/addison16/commanders-table`; no public rename or publication was performed. IndexedDB/database identifiers, SQLite data and schema, room protocols, export payload identifiers, icons and the PWA start URL are unchanged. Older backups remain supported despite their previous filename prefix. The already implemented local fresh-game/rematch and automatic-layout features remain included; additional feature suggestions were not implemented as part of this rebrand.

ESLint, TypeScript, the production build, **140 unit/integration checks**, actionlint and formatting pass. Existing branding assertions were updated. Private Chromium and WebKit browser checks passed for the new branding and importing an export with the old filename prefix. Production PWA checks pass in both engines for offline reopening and prompted updates.

The local image `command-table:local-rebrand` (`4106ec7e9b01`, version `0.1.5-local.3`, OCI title **Command Table**) passed the isolated x64 container smoke test for non-root startup, SQLite, rooms, membership, receipt deduplication, recreation, backup and restore. It is deployed on the existing service, configuration and volume. The verified `before-command-table-20260917.sqlite` backup remains in the volume and was copied to the host; `commanders-table:before-command-table-20260917` retains the previous image. Exact before/after hashes match all 38 rooms, 62 memberships, 195 events, zero snapshots and 65 session identities/revocation flags. The container is healthy and the HTTPS health endpoint returned 200.

A live browser holding the previous service worker applied **Save & update**, then **Confirm**, and retained its exact saved game: Mira, blue, Jace and 39 life. The header, browser title, manifest and export filename use the new name. Icon bytes matched exactly, and automatic portrait/landscape layouts plus a manual override persisted correctly through reload. No physical-phone or installed-app label-refresh validation is implied. Nothing has been committed, pushed or published; public releases remain at v0.1.5 with their existing names and addresses.

## September 17 local automatic mobile table layouts

Phones and tablets now follow device rotation by default, including when loading an existing profile: landscape uses **Shared table**, and portrait uses **All facing me**. Detection applies to coarse-pointer devices and prefers the native Screen Orientation API, then legacy `window.orientation`, then physical screen dimensions. Viewport resizing alone does not determine the layout, so opening a keyboard does not flip the table. Desktop layouts remain manual.

The effective layout is derived without writing game or profile data on rotation. Automatic layout ignores saved individual-seat flips so the far and near rows face consistently. Choosing a layout or deliberately flipping a seat turns automatic switching off and retains the current layout; **Follow device rotation** turns it on again. The preference and layout are independent on each device. A shared guest's **My seat** view stays personal, with seat permissions unchanged. Rotation cancels a held life control before repositioning it.

ESLint, TypeScript, the production build and **140 unit/integration checks** pass. The updated storage regression verifies automatic behavior for older profiles and persistence of an explicit opt-out. A read-only design review found no blockers. All **22 targeted Chromium/WebKit browser cases** pass: 18 new orientation cases plus four existing manual shared-table/artwork regressions. They cover orientation fallbacks, keyboard resizing, older profiles, manual override and re-enabling, held-input cancellation, independent room-device layouts and the guest My seat view.

Separate production checks in Chromium and WebKit used native, unmocked browser orientation behavior to verify automatic portrait/landscape changes, reload behavior, exact game-state preservation and working far/near life taps. The settings passed a 320-pixel layout and automated accessibility check. Production PWA prompted-update and offline-reopening checks pass in both engines. These are automated browser checks, not physical-phone validation.

The local `commanders-table:local-auto-layout` image (`1a8c50b7d799`, version `0.1.5-local.2`) passed the isolated x64 container smoke test and is deployed with the existing Compose project, configuration, origin and volume. The verified `before-auto-layout-20260917.sqlite` backup was copied to the host, and `commanders-table:before-auto-layout-20260917` retains the previous image. Exact before/after hashes match all 38 rooms, 62 memberships, 195 events, zero snapshots and 65 session identities/revocation flags. The container is healthy and the HTTPS health endpoint returned 200.

A live mobile Chromium browser holding the previous service worker applied **Save & update**, then **Confirm**, and retained the exact 39-life Mira/Jace game. Native landscape rotation selected Shared table with the far two players facing across; portrait returned all players to upright. Rotation and reload stayed correct, and a manual All facing me override persisted after reload. The game remained exactly unchanged throughout. No physical-phone validation is implied. These changes remain local; nothing has been committed, pushed or published, and public GitHub/Docker releases remain at v0.1.5. The prior fresh-game/rematch refinement is included in this preview.

## September 17 local fresh-game and rematch refinement

**New game** opens a fresh setup in both one-phone and multiple-phone modes: four players, default names and colors, one default commander per player, no artwork and the default 40-life Commander settings. It no longer copies the current or previously saved setup. **End game** now offers **Rematch**, **End game** and **Cancel**. Rematch uses the existing reset behavior: it restores the configured starting life, clears counters, poison, damage, casts, markers, elimination, turns, timer state, dice and undo/redo history, and keeps current names, colors, commanders/artwork, settings and seat identities. Player details remain editable afterward. Existing ending, 24-hour recovery and rematch snapshots remain available.

The generic confirmation dialog retains its Confirm/Cancel behavior, focuses Cancel when opened and scrolls within a short sideways viewport. End/rematch and standalone-rematch prompts reject stale actions when another tab has replaced the game. Pending commands also disable game-menu actions.

ESLint, TypeScript, the production build and **140 unit/integration checks** pass. Three new parameterized domain cases cover 40, 20 and custom 73 starting life, each from active and ended games. They verify complete resets, unchanged source games, preserved profiles/partners/artwork and continued profile editing. All **22 targeted Chromium/WebKit browser cases** pass: 21 in the combined run and the existing WebKit audio case on a rerun with the documented GStreamer plugin path. The five new scenarios run in both engines and cover fresh setup in each mode, local cancellation/rematch/editing, shared seats and permissions, and stale rematch prompts.

Production PWA checks pass in both browser engines for prompted updates and offline reopening. Separate production browser checks at 320 pixels and 568 × 320 verified prompt accessibility and fit, initial Cancel focus, cancellation without game changes, a 20-life rematch and persistence after reload in both engines.

The locally built image `commanders-table:local-new-game` (`81b3ca7cc061`, version `0.1.5-local.1`) passed the isolated x64 container smoke test and is deployed on the existing Compose service, volume and origin. The private deployment configuration selects this local image. The verified `before-new-game-20260917.sqlite` backup was copied to the host, and `commanders-table:before-new-game-20260917` retains the previous image. Exact before/after hashes match all 38 rooms, 62 memberships, 195 events, zero snapshots and 65 session identities/revocation flags. The container is healthy and the HTTPS health endpoint returned 200.

A live Chromium browser holding the previous service worker applied **Save & update**, then **Confirm**, and retained its exact 39-life game with the blue Mira player and Jace commander. **End game → Rematch** restored 40 life with the same names, colors, commanders and seat identities, and survived reload. **New game** then produced fresh default player/commander names, no artwork, new identities and reset stats. No physical-phone or installed-mode validation is implied. These changes have not been committed, pushed or published; public GitHub and Docker releases remain at v0.1.5.

## September 17 v0.1.5 publication

The user explicitly requested publication of the current improvements. Release commit `0f78df4` adds **View commander** for full card images and readable rules, including partners, multiple faces, lookup retry and image-failure fallback. Approved guests can read another player's commander without changing edit permissions. It also adds a more visible Home settings button, circular life-control feedback with the existing touch areas, and correct 429 responses for card-route request limits. Game-save and SQLite schemas are unchanged.

[Main verification](https://github.com/Addison16/commanders-table/actions/runs/35279446793) completed successfully. Every validation job in the [v0.1.5 release workflow](https://github.com/Addison16/commanders-table/actions/runs/35279446951) passed **137 unit/integration checks across 8 files**, **71 Chromium/WebKit browser cases with 3 expected skips**, production PWA offline/prompted-update checks in both engines, HTTPS/WSS proxy checks, and native amd64/arm64 container smoke tests. Local lint, types, production build, release validation and actionlint also passed.

The release workflow successfully built and published both image platforms, the version/stable/latest tags and the GitHub release. Its final asset upload encountered an HTTP 500 from GitHub for `compose.yaml`, leaving that attachment missing and the workflow marked failed. Retrying only the missing attachment with `gh release upload` succeeded. Both downloads were then fetched anonymously and matched the source exactly; no image rebuild or tag change was needed for this recovery.

Anonymous registry checks verified `0.1.5` and `stable` at `sha256:78b8a8929a3429a8a65cd0e02f9d9b2714da6d585150508bc3e25cf176231024`. The dedicated `latest` index is `sha256:35b83294597b5b485d434fc71643adc804a586922fd7b4e7cff1f85271ee7c9a`; its platform/attestation descriptors match the versioned index and its separate annotation keeps the package install command on `latest`. Both amd64 and arm64 images have version `0.1.5`, revision `0f78df485f5514224dc04817f0f369312e567e9f` and the `PolyForm-Noncommercial-1.0.0` license label. Embedded license files match the source exactly. An actual anonymous Docker pull passed. Historical `0.1.0`, `0.1.1`, `0.1.2` and `0.1.4` digests are unchanged.

The public [v0.1.5 release](https://github.com/Addison16/commanders-table/releases/tag/v0.1.5), `compose.yaml` and `docker.env.example` were verified without authentication. Both source ZIP and tar.gz archives contain 130 files, all matching the tagged Git tree byte for byte. Package versions, the new reader/component styles/browser tests, release notes and license match the source. Private configuration, credentials, databases, local instructions and runtime/test artifacts are excluded. The package landing page's first install command is `docker pull ghcr.io/addison16/commanders-table:latest`.

The anonymously pulled public image passed a separate isolated native x64 container smoke test for non-root startup, SQLite, room commands, receipt deduplication, recreation, memberships, backup and restore. The existing service then moved to public v0.1.5 at revision `0f78df4`, keeping the same Compose project, configuration, origin and volume. The verified `before-v015-20260917.sqlite` backup was copied out, and `commanders-table:before-v015-20260917` retains the previous image. Exact before/after hashes matched for all 38 rooms, 62 memberships, 195 events, zero snapshots and 65 session identities/revocation flags. The container is healthy and the HTTPS health endpoint returned 200.

A Chromium browser holding the previous service worker retained its exact saved game across the release reload, including 39 life, a blue player and the Jace commander. **View commander** then loaded real front/back scans larger than 500 pixels, readable rules and the back face's loyalty of 5, without changing the game. No physical-phone or installed-mode validation is implied. The earlier local preview checks below remain historical evidence of the same application changes.

## September 17 local commander card reader

Player profiles now offer **View commander** with full card images and readable rules, mana cost, type and stats. Partners and double-faced cards have separate selections. Approved guests can read another player's commander while existing edit permissions remain unchanged. The runtime game/save schema is unchanged; card details are display-only. Card-route rate limiting also now returns the intended **429** response instead of an accidental **500**.

ESLint, TypeScript, the production build and **137 unit/integration checks** pass. All **20 targeted Chromium/WebKit browser cases** pass, covering the new reader plus commander artwork and unified player-save regressions. Reader checks verify saved-art versus name-only lookups, unchanged room/local game state, other-seat edit restrictions, partner/face selection, lookup retry, readable text after image failure, unnamed-commander hints, keyboard focus, a 320-pixel layout and automated accessibility.

A separate real-Scryfall browser check verified Jace's front/back card images and text, including the back face's loyalty, at 320 pixels. Previously read text reopened during an outage from in-memory cache. This cache belongs only to the current tab, expires after up to one hour and clears on reload; the check does not establish offline card downloads or persistent full-image availability.

Production PWA checks passed in Chromium and WebKit for prompted updates, offline reopening and exclusion of private API responses from caches. The locally built x64 image passed isolated container checks for startup, SQLite, room operations, recreation, backup and restore.

The local service now runs image `e69c7180fc6b`, version `0.1.4-local.3`, with a verified backup and the previous image retained. The existing configuration and volume were preserved; only the image changed. Exact before/after hashes matched for all 38 rooms, 62 memberships, 195 events, zero snapshots and 65 sessions. Health checks passed. A browser holding the previous service worker applied **Save & update** over HTTPS and retained its exact game, including 39 life and Jace artwork. **View commander** then loaded real front/back scans, rules and the back face's loyalty of 5 without changing that game. These changes remain local and have not been published.

## September 17 v0.1.4 publication

The user explicitly requested publication of the latest app. The v0.1.4 source includes optional Scryfall commander backgrounds from the canceled v0.1.3 publication, unified player saves, automatic player dice defaults, the browser storage-abort fix, and the package-page `latest` install command. The existing v0.1.3 tag is preserved. Local checks passed all 128 unit/integration checks, ESLint, TypeScript, the production build, release validation and actionlint.

[Main verification](https://github.com/Addison16/commanders-table/actions/runs/35213830032) and the [v0.1.4 release workflow](https://github.com/Addison16/commanders-table/actions/runs/35213830381) completed successfully for release commit `02667b8`. Both runs passed **128 unit/integration checks across 8 files**, **63 Chromium/WebKit browser cases with 3 expected skips**, production PWA offline/prompted-update checks in both engines, HTTPS/WSS proxy checks, and native amd64/arm64 container smoke tests.

Anonymous registry checks verified `0.1.4` and `stable` at `sha256:a51f5a903ac2adbb6e78cd502e9530cba215e24ce5a88193c478e1b039d74a2f`. The dedicated `latest` index is `sha256:af5c1aadde22c2f1332fb2f6d886eb405045f3fbc51e3a9282057c7a6c06abae`; it has identical platform/attestation descriptors and a separate latest annotation for the package display. Both amd64 and arm64 images have the correct version, source revision and `PolyForm-Noncommercial-1.0.0` license label, with embedded license files matching the source. An actual anonymous Docker pull passed. The historical `0.1.0`, `0.1.1` and `0.1.2` image digests are unchanged.

The public [v0.1.4 release](https://github.com/Addison16/commanders-table/releases/tag/v0.1.4) and its downloads were verified without authentication. Both `compose.yaml` and `docker.env.example` match the source exactly. The source archive includes the improvements and excludes private files. The package landing page's first install command is `docker pull ghcr.io/addison16/commanders-table:latest`.

The anonymously pulled public image passed the isolated native x64 container smoke, covering startup, SQLite, room commands, receipt deduplication, recreation, backup and restore. The existing service then moved to public v0.1.4 at revision `02667b8`, keeping the same configuration and volume. Before/after checksums matched for all 38 rooms, 62 memberships, 195 events, zero snapshots and 65 sessions. A verified backup and the previous image were retained. Container and HTTPS health checks passed.

A Chromium browser retained its exact saved game across the release and reload, including its 39-life score and blue player. A combined name, color and commander save committed one revision and survived another reload. The subsequent roll automatically selected that player and rendered matching blue dice, verified on the canvas. No physical-phone or installed-mode validation is implied.

## September 16 GitHub package install command

The user requested `docker pull ghcr.io/addison16/commanders-table:latest` in GitHub's generated package install box. README/release-note edits alone did not change that box, and re-pushing an identical index retained its original display tag. A metadata-only index tagged exclusively `latest` made the anonymous package landing page display the requested command. Its digest was `sha256:48d7bdfeeac34e2cb0a728ebcd211ba08ad1b388625e39d779e67375177b9977`; every platform/attestation descriptor matched the published v0.1.2 index exactly. At that check, the `0.1.2`, `stable` and original SHA tags retained `sha256:3f4ccaa61de2c672b7f196b282254b0e68c88f193ad35948ed8b4e0925aa24f5`.

The manual metadata workflow [passed](https://github.com/Addison16/commanders-table/actions/runs/35174866901), and the package page plus anonymous registry reads verify the result. Future stable releases publish a separate annotated latest index after their version/SHA/stable tags; prereleases do not change latest. `actionlint` passes for both packaging workflows. Only packaging workflow commits were pushed for this correction; local player-save/dice fixes and the running local image were unchanged and unpublished at that time.

## September 16 local player-save and dice-color fixes

Player details now submit name, color and all commander labels/artwork through one atomic `editPlayer` command. Host/own-seat permissions, existing commander IDs, casts and damage remain intact, and one Undo restores the whole edit. The form waits for durable local storage or a matching successful room acknowledgement before clearing drafts. Rejected, interrupted and timed-out saves retain edits for retry. Local dice default to the last saved or selected player and use that player's current color; explicit neutral table rolls and shared-seat defaults remain available.

All **128 unit/integration checks across 8 files**, ESLint, TypeScript and production build pass. The Chromium/WebKit suite passes **63 cases with 3 expected skips**, across the initial suites and focused reruns. New checks inspect real dice canvas colors after changing a third player's profile without touching **Roll for**, combined partner/artwork saves, single undo, shared live drafts, and durable-save failure/retry. The failure test exposed an unhandled IndexedDB transaction `AbortError`; handling its completion rejection immediately fixes the error while preserving rollback and failure reporting. The new storage regression and both browser failure journeys pass after the fix. Production offline/prompted-update checks and HTTPS/cookie/CSRF/WSS smoke checks pass.

The local Node 24 image `commanders-table:local-player-save` (`sha256:bd22cb3d75eef4719ae6775511952ff3981798901e462a7b5d7af1ae56a26a3a`, version label `0.1.3-local.2`) passed the isolated container smoke and is deployed on the existing service and volume. The database backup `before-player-save-20260916.sqlite` was verified and copied out; `commanders-table:before-player-save-20260916` retains the previous app. Before/after database checksums match for all 38 rooms, 62 memberships, 195 events, zero snapshots and 65 session identities/revocation flags. Container and HTTPS health pass.

A browser running the previous live app applied **Save & update** and retained its exact saved game. It then changed a third player's name, color and commander in one save, verified a single revision, reloaded, and rolled a matching blue d20 without changing **Roll for**. The live unified editor was visually inspected. No commits, tags, releases or Docker images were pushed or published for these fixes during that local update; they are included in the subsequent v0.1.4 release candidate.

## September 16 v0.1.3 commander artwork

Scryfall integration adds 23 mocked API/schema checks for trusted links, double-faced cards, bounded response/queue/cache handling, request spacing, and rate-limit cooldown. Domain/room regressions verify aligned partner cards, legacy saves, rename/remove/undo/rematch behavior, pending-profile persistence and own-seat permissions. All **110 unit/integration checks across 8 files** pass, along with ESLint, TypeScript and the production build.

The new browser journeys use mocked card metadata and the project's original icon as the image fixture. They exercise name suggestions and pasted links, selection/removal/reload, guest approval and shared backgrounds, partner layout/rotation, failed/stale requests, image failure/online recovery, and automated accessibility checks. Initial timeouts came from two exact label locators on wrapping labels; corrected role locators identify the existing controls.

A separate real-service check selected and displayed four Scryfall commander cards, verified artist attribution, and visually inspected portrait and sideways shared-table layouts. With production CSP and service workers enabled, real Scryfall art loaded as a successful CORS response, entered the bounded image cache, and survived an actual app-origin outage and subsequent life edits/reloads in Chromium and WebKit. WebKit's offline network emulation produced an internal navigation error, so this check uses the same real-origin outage approach as the existing PWA smoke test. Production prompted updates, private-API cache exclusion and HTTPS/cookie/CSRF/WSS checks also pass.

The complete Chromium/WebKit suite passes: **57 passed, with 3 expected skips** (60 cases total). Native amd64 and arm64 container checks also passed in the [release workflow](https://github.com/Addison16/commanders-table/actions/runs/35171924048). That workflow was canceled before publication; the v0.1.3 source tag already exists, but no v0.1.3 GitHub release or public Docker image was published. Anonymous registry inspection at that time confirmed that `latest` still pointed to the v0.1.2 digest and `0.1.3` returned not found. Publication was deferred until an explicit user request. No physical-phone verification is implied.

The local Node 24 image `commanders-table:local-artwork` (`sha256:1169984204a7ddfa559f4bf2ba45a449dcaf4267942d34eaa9d24bd35b190eab`, version label `0.1.3-local`) passed the isolated container smoke, including SQLite, room commands, recreation, backup and restore. It was deployed on the existing service, HTTPS origin and database volume. The private deployment environment selects this local image; its previous configuration is backed up. A verified `before-local-artwork-20260916.sqlite` database backup was copied out before recreation, and `commanders-table:before-v013-20260916` retains the prior image. All 38 rooms, 62 memberships, 195 events, zero snapshots and 65 session identities/revocation flags matched exactly afterward.

A browser holding the prior live service worker applied **Save & update** and preserved its exact 39-life game and blue player. It then resolved a real Scryfall commander, saved and displayed the artwork/credits, verified the production image cache, reloaded with the same card and life total, and rolled the matching blue die. HTTPS health and container health pass. These final verification notes were kept local until the subsequent request to publish v0.1.4.

## September 16 v0.1.2 bug review and player-colored dice

The review added regression coverage for canceled room reconnects, concurrent recent-room/archive writes, stale offline snapshots, live form drafts, shared dice-player identity, expired memberships, recovery transitions, and cloned browser-tab identities. The original exact-life form reproduced a stale 20 after decreasing life to 19; the corrected form follows saved changes while preserving an unfinished typed value. Four storage/reconnect regressions were also confirmed failing before their fixes.

Local checks pass: ESLint, TypeScript, production build, **84 unit/integration checks across 7 files**, and the complete Chromium/WebKit browser suite: **49 passed, with 3 expected skips**. Production service-worker updates preserve the game in both engines, offline play survives a real origin outage and reload, and HTTPS/cookie/CSRF/WSS checks pass. `npm audit --omit=dev` reports no known vulnerabilities. Browser checks use an isolated database/API port while the existing deployment remains online.

Dice checks verify actual colored pixels on the rendered canvas, selected player identity across ordinary rolls, percentile pairs, rerolls and persisted replays, and matching room results for both browser participants. Unit checks cover every palette, tied-player colors, and keeping random first-player selection neutral until reveal. The rounded geometry and upright-number checks remain intact. See [player-colored-dice.png](screenshots/player-colored-dice.png).

The shared brand SVG uses the homepage symbol's exact path/circle geometry. Browser inspection confirms the header and favicon use it; regenerated 192/512-pixel install icons match it and preserve maskable padding. The README's four/eight-player screenshots were refreshed with the unified logo.

Duplicate-tab checks use real Web Locks in both browser engines and verify reload, takeover and restored-page handling. When Web Locks is unavailable or denied, existing IndexedDB revision checks remain the safeguard; no physical-device verification is implied. Storage identifiers and SQLite schema are unchanged. Release metadata uses `PolyForm-Noncommercial-1.0.0`; historical release permissions and third-party notices remain intact.

[Main verification](https://github.com/Addison16/commanders-table/actions/runs/35168228621) and the [v0.1.2 release workflow](https://github.com/Addison16/commanders-table/actions/runs/35168229381) both passed the full application/browser gate, production offline/update and HTTPS checks, and native amd64/arm64 container smoke tests. The hosted suites also reported 84 unit/integration passes and 49 browser passes with 3 expected skips.

Anonymous registry requests verified matching `0.1.2`, `latest` and `stable` tags at `sha256:3f4ccaa61de2c672b7f196b282254b0e68c88f193ad35948ed8b4e0925aa24f5`. Both platform images have the intended license label and an embedded `/app/LICENSE` matching the source byte for byte. An empty Docker credential directory successfully pulled the image. The public release notes contain the correct digest and license; both setup downloads match the source. Historical `0.1.0` and `0.1.1` image digests remain unchanged.

The live service runs v0.1.2 using the published image, existing HTTPS origin, Compose project and database volume. The verified `before-v0.1.2-20260916.sqlite` backup was copied out and matched every captured table checksum; `commanders-table:before-v012-20260916` retains the previous image. Before/after checksums matched for all 38 rooms, 62 memberships, 195 events, zero snapshots and 65 session identities/revocation flags. The container and HTTPS health checks pass.

A Chromium browser holding the v0.1.1 service worker applied **Save & update** and preserved the exact local game, including its ID, 39-life score and blue player. It then rolled a d20 with that player's identity and verified blue pixels in the rendered dice. A fresh live browser verified the header, favicon, Apple icon and both manifest icons against the exact released source artwork. The local source checkout is synchronized with GitHub; subsequent documentation records do not change the tagged application image.

## September 16 v0.1.1 licensing release

The v0.1.1 release uses MIT with Commons Clause for the application, documentation and original assets. The package and root lockfile point to `LICENSE`; both the Dockerfile and release metadata explicitly use `LicenseRef-MIT-Commons-Clause-1.0`. The release validator, `actionlint`, targeted formatting checks and `git diff --check` pass. A comparison with the previous lockfile confirms every third-party dependency entry is unchanged. Runtime code, public assets, tests and schema are unchanged, and the existing v0.1.0 tag still contains its original MIT license.

[Main verification](https://github.com/Addison16/commanders-table/actions/runs/35165575775) and the [v0.1.1 release workflow](https://github.com/Addison16/commanders-table/actions/runs/35165571310) both passed. The release gate includes 58 unit/integration checks, 39 Chromium/WebKit journeys with 3 expected skips, production offline/update and HTTPS checks, and native amd64/arm64 container smoke tests.

Anonymous registry requests verified matching `0.1.1`, `latest` and `stable` tags at `sha256:27fd6c365bf002c50f7eb4b3440abc2d0b3a33ead0f7cffd47044734461c9b05`. Both platform manifests have the intended OCI license label, and their embedded `/app/LICENSE` files match the source byte for byte. An empty Docker credential directory successfully pulled the public image. Public release notes contain the licensing change and correct digest; both setup downloads match their source files. The historical `0.1.0` image retains its original digest, and its source license remains MIT.

The v0.1.1 deployment ran with the same HTTPS origin, Compose project and database volume. A verified `before-license-0.1.1-20260916.sqlite` backup was copied out before recreation; `commanders-table:before-license-20260916` retains the previous image. Database checksums matched for all 38 rooms, 62 memberships, 194 events, zero snapshots and 65 session identities/revocation flags. The container is healthy, and a Chromium visit verified HTTPS health, the Commander's Table title and the initial game options.

The records below describe their respective historical versions; the v0.1.0 MIT evidence remains valid for that release.

## September 16 public release and deployment

[Release v0.1.0](https://github.com/Addison16/commanders-table/releases/tag/v0.1.0) is published under MIT. Both [main verification](https://github.com/Addison16/commanders-table/actions/runs/35163472611) and the [release workflow](https://github.com/Addison16/commanders-table/actions/runs/35163473158) passed: 58 unit/integration checks, 39 Chromium/WebKit journeys with 3 expected skips, production PWA updates and origin-outage reloads, HTTPS/cookie/CSRF/WSS checks, and native amd64/arm64 container smoke tests.

Anonymous registry requests verified both platform manifests and matching `0.1.0`, `stable`, and `latest` tags at `sha256:c93896565678eddcdccc08254d4c70cf1ed6407650376ec26c5395249c2b6b88`. An empty Docker credential directory successfully pulled the public image, and the downloaded x64 image passed the full isolated container smoke. Public source access, MIT license metadata, release notes/digest, both setup-file downloads, exact file contents, and the downloaded Compose configuration were verified. GitHub had normalized the dot-prefixed environment asset name; the published download and future workflow now use `docker.env.example` consistently.

The live deployment now uses the published `latest` image through `compose.yaml`, retaining its existing Compose project, volume, and HTTPS origin. A fresh `before-public-release-20260916.sqlite` backup passed integrity checks and was copied out before recreation. Checksums matched for all 38 rooms, 62 memberships, 194 events, and 65 session identities/revocation flags. Health and the new title passed in a browser over the configured HTTPS origin. A browser holding the prior service worker applied **Save & update**, displayed the new name, and retained the same local game ID and 39-life score. The previous app remains available as `mtg-util:before-commanders-table-20260916`.

## September 16 Commander's Table naming

The chosen name is applied to the interface, browser/install metadata, exported filenames, source repository links, and published image configuration. Internal storage and protocol identifiers are unchanged for compatibility. TypeScript, ESLint, the production build, all 58 unit/integration checks, and eight focused Chromium/WebKit layout, saved-game, and accessibility journeys pass. Updated four/eight-player and sideways-table screenshots show the new heading; the 320-pixel layout remains within the viewport. The release workflows pass `actionlint`, and the downloadable Compose/environment example validates.

The first hosted run passed native amd64/arm64 container checks and 38 browser cases. Its WebKit accessibility trace sampled the panel entrance at half opacity. Axe opens a temporary page that can background the app; the accessibility journey now brings the app to the foreground and waits for full panel opacity before scanning. It retains all contrast checks and passes in both subsequent hosted runs.

## September 16 public-release preparation

The publication candidate passes TypeScript, ESLint, production build, and **58 Vitest checks**. The complete Chromium/WebKit suite passes **39 cases with 3 expected skips**. Production service-worker updates and real-origin offline reloads pass in both engines, as does the HTTPS/cookie/CSRF/WSS smoke check.

`actionlint` 1.7.12 validates the reusable CI and release workflows, and Docker Compose validates the downloadable environment example. The release validator accepts `v0.1.0` and rejects mismatched or malformed tags. Workflow actions are pinned to commits resolved from official release tags. Publication files were checked for credential patterns and local deployment addresses; databases, backups, environment overrides, browser caches, and local authentication files are ignored. Hosted Actions and public registry pulls remain pending the first authenticated publication.

The final Node 24 release candidate (`f699df37e4e4`) passed the native x64 container smoke: non-root startup, native SQLite, assets/health, create/join/approve/update, receipt deduplication, recreation with memberships intact, online backup, and stopped restore. The image includes the MIT license and OCI source/license labels. Its tests used an isolated temporary volume.

## September 16 joining-player setup

TypeScript, ESLint, formatting, the production build, and **58 Vitest checks across 4 files** pass. All **14 targeted Chromium/WebKit browser cases** for shared rooms, joining-player setup, ended-game recovery, and dice sound pass. The 20-life cases were rerun after correcting the test's preset selector; the application required no change for that failure.

New checks cover pending profile privacy and persistence, revising requests, one/two commander labels, host-only atomic approval, competing/stale requests, deduplicated approval, preserving life/damage/casts/IDs, and protecting a tracked partner from removal. A database test recreates schema version 1 with saved rooms and sessions, upgrades it to version 2, and verifies that pending choices survive reopening the database. Commander-disabled rooms apply the name without changing their commander records.

Browser journeys exercise a joining player choosing and updating partners, refreshing while pending, host preview/approval, retaining life totals, editing their own commander afterward, and being unable to edit another player's names. The 20-life journey hides commander fields and uses the guest's selected name. Axe passes on the new form in both engines; the 320-pixel layout has no horizontal overflow. The lobby was visually inspected in [join-player-setup.png](screenshots/join-player-setup.png).

Image `f3b39ef6c9e4` was deployed to the existing HTTPS service after creating and verifying `before-join-profile-2026-09-16.sqlite`. Migration 1 → 2 preserved all **33 existing rooms and 53 memberships**, with matching hashes of stored room IDs/revisions/game JSON and all existing membership columns. All **4 new joining-player browser cases** also passed against the configured HTTPS deployment, and the live health endpoint passed. The prior image is retained as `mtg-util:before-join-profile-20260916`; rolling back to it requires the matching schema-1 backup.

## September 16 ivory dice, ended-game recovery, and audio

TypeScript, ESLint, formatting, the production build, and **53 Vitest checks across 4 files** pass. The complete Chromium/WebKit development suite passed **35 cases with 3 expected skips**, covering the same production-only/CDP exceptions described below.

Rounded dice geometry is checked for closed, paired edges and finite outward normals at both rendering detail levels for every supported shape. Existing browser checks still verify upright, centered result numbers through full animation and reduced motion. The ivory surfaces, rounded edges, and Recently ended games screen were visually inspected; screenshots are in [screenshots](screenshots/).

Recovery checks cover returning to the initial mode choices after ending a game, surviving a reload and starting another game, and restoring the original IDs, life totals, damage, history, and paused timer. Storage tests exercise competing tab leases and the exact 24-hour deadline. Shared-room tests verify host-only reopening, original guest seats and totals, expired recovery rejection, and both participants returning to the restored board.

Both browser engines measured nonzero audio samples from the actual output graph during dice previews and rolls. Tests also suspend the AudioContext before a roll, verify it resumes and produces sound, and confirm disabling sound prevents further sources. These checks establish browser audio generation, not physical-phone speaker output or operating-system mute behavior.

This Arch-based host lacked GStreamer's automatic audio sink for WebKit. Matching `gst-plugins-good` automatic/PulseAudio sink libraries were extracted into ignored `.browser-cache/gst-good/`, without modifying system packages. The executed browser command used `GST_PLUGIN_PATH_1_0="$PWD/.browser-cache/gst-good" PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=.browser-cache npm run test:e2e`. Supported Ubuntu CI should install its browser dependencies with `playwright install --with-deps`.

The Node 24 production image was deployed with the HTTPS origin and database volume preserved. A fresh SQLite backup passed its integrity check before recreation. All **31 existing rooms and 49 memberships** matched afterward, including a checksum of every stored room ID, revision, and game JSON. The previous image is retained as `mtg-util:before-ivory-recovery-20260916`; the new image is `b415da7b984d`. The live HTTPS health endpoint and all **10 focused display, recovery, and sound browser checks** passed against the configured HTTPS deployment in Chromium and WebKit.

## September 16 dice polish and shared-table layout

The update passes TypeScript, ESLint, formatting, the production build, and **43 Vitest checks across 4 files**. The complete browser suite passed against the deployed HTTPS site: **29 cases passed, 3 expected skips**, across Chromium and WebKit. New coverage checks the final face normal and glyph axes of every dice mesh, backward-compatible profile loading, and saved layout preferences without changing the installation ID or manual seat flips.

Browser scenarios inspect the actual canvas lettering transforms for d4/d6/d8/d10/d12/d20, both percentile dice, and the coin. Result numbers face the camera, remain upright, and are centered after both full animation and reduced motion. Shared-table checks verify the two far-side seats rotate exactly 180 degrees, both near-side seats stay upright, taps affect the correct players, and totals/layout survive a confirmed save and reload. Manual overrides and switching back to All facing me also work. Axe checks the layout selector in both engines.

All four seats and their eight life controls fit without scrolling at 844×390 and 568×320; each life button is at least 64×52 CSS pixels. The 320×568 portrait view has no horizontal overflow. A separate Chromium check verified poison warnings and turn markers remain inside their panels in the compact landscape layout. The final dice and both landscape layouts were visually inspected; see `dice-upright.png` and `shared-table-*.png` in [screenshots](screenshots/).

The Node 24 image was deployed to the existing service with its database volume and HTTPS-origin configuration preserved. A new verified SQLite backup was saved before recreation. All **27 existing rooms and 43 memberships**, including a checksum of the stored room IDs, revisions and game JSON, matched exactly afterward. The previous image remains tagged for rollback. The deployment uses a configured HTTPS origin; direct LAN HTTP still serves the frontend, but room mutations correctly reject an origin different from the configured HTTPS site.

## September 16 refinements

The updated app passed TypeScript, ESLint, production build, and **42 Vitest checks across 4 files**. The full phone-sized Chromium/WebKit suite passed **25 cases with 3 expected skips** (the same production-only/CDP exceptions described below). Added coverage verifies:

- Actual closed dice meshes for d4/d6/d8/d10/d12/d20, animated canvas frames over the visible board, and winner text remaining absent through a forced tie reroll. Both engines pass an Axe scan of the result dialog. Reduced motion, skip, persisted results and browser Back work without generating another result.
- Player/commander edits retaining life, commander damage and original IDs/history after new-game mode selection, switching games and reload; optional turn controls appearing beside Undo and disappearing when disabled.
- Dice after an ended game, automatic recovery of an expired tab lease, and approved guests rolling for everyone with identical results on both browsers. Shared turns remain host-controlled.
- Bounded unfinished local saves, older archive resumption, rematch/ended-game exclusion, and another tab's lease being respected. Shared recent-game summaries require the existing guest cookie, omit private game/invitation data, and exclude revoked, ended and expired rooms. A browser can switch to local play, then resume its original shared seat.

The production PWA update and real-origin-outage script passed again in both engines. A separate Chromium check exercised all seven dice sizes, total calculations, the coin, and the maximum 20d100 roll (40 visual dice) at 320×568 with reduced motion. Dice were visually inspected in portrait and landscape; screenshots are in `docs/screenshots/`. These are browser checks, not physical-phone measurements.

The updated Node 24 Docker image was deployed to the existing LAN service on port 8080. The live database was backed up with SQLite's backup API and verified before recreation; the existing 23 room records and 37 memberships matched exactly afterward, including a hash of all saved room IDs, revisions and game JSON. All ten refinement/shared-room browser cases passed against the deployed LAN URL in Chromium/WebKit. Health also responded through the LAN IP from a separate Docker bridge. The original database volume and a tagged pre-update image were retained.

## Original milestone verification

Implementation checks were run on September 15, 2026 (America/Chicago; some artifact timestamps are September 16 UTC). Host: Linux x86_64, Node 22.23.2, npm 10.9.8. Production containers used Node 24. Browser automation used Playwright 1.63.0 with its Chromium and WebKit builds. The repository targets Node 24 through `.nvmrc`.

The development suite skips its two production-only offline cases; `npm run test:pwa` provides the full production offline/update check in both engines. The third skip is WebKit's CDP-only simultaneous touch injection test. Chromium injects two independent touches at once; both engines separately exercise real pointer holds and cancellation. WebKit's `context.setOffline(true)` could not navigate the cached app in this environment, while a real unreachable origin succeeded. The PWA script deliberately tests that actual outage instead of treating the emulator failure as an application pass.

A simultaneous-touch test originally refreshed immediately after the optimistic totals appeared, while saves were still pending. It now waits for **Saved here** before asserting durable totals after refresh. Reload guarantees the last committed IndexedDB transaction; the UI explicitly distinguishes pending input from a confirmed save. Shared pending changes likewise have an awaiting-confirmation label and retain their original operation IDs for recovery.

## Coverage details

Domain tests exercise 1–8 seats, bounded/negative life, poison limits, stable identities after rename/reorder, partners and own-commander damage, life independence, atomic damage/life undo, correction semantics, hold grouping, 60 undo actions, redo branching, per-commander casts, elimination/marker behavior, rematch IDs, timestamp timers, rejection sampling, tied d20 rerolls, and invalid/future imports.

IndexedDB tests exercise committed reloads, stale writes, explicit takeover, corrupt-record preservation, checkpoints, bounded archives, and credential-free exports. Browser tests also block storage and remove `crypto.randomUUID()` to exercise the memory warning and fallback. The LAN smoke uses a real insecure origin where `randomUUID()` is absent without mocking it.

Room tests cover pending-guest privacy; own-seat versus host/global permissions; concurrent relative deltas; stale absolute revisions; conservative undo; atomic competing seat assignments; replacement revocation; receipt lookup after rematch, host transfer, revocation, restart, and more than 200 events; code rotation/join locks; expiry cleanup; rolling sessions and expired authority; and eight approved guests converging on a single state and recorded dice roll. The eight-participant case is a server integration test, not eight physical phones.

Independent browser contexts perform create → invitation link → display name → seat request → host approval → simultaneous edits → disconnect/reconnect → refresh/seat recovery → My seat → matching dice. A WebSocket interception test loses a real acknowledgement after server commit, reloads, and verifies that the persisted operation is retried once with its original ID and removed from the outbox.

Local journeys exercise life, combined damage, undo, save/refresh/resume, JSON download/import, negative six-digit life, reduced motion, sheet/browser-back behavior, focus restoration, two-tab takeover, holds, and exact two-touch counts. Axe scans the home, board, and player dialog for WCAG 2 A/AA and 2.1 AA issues in both engines. Keyboard and focus checks supplement those scans; automated scans are not full screen-reader certification.

Responsive automation checks 320×568, 390×844, 844×390, 768×1024, and 1440×900. All eight seats remain reachable, no horizontal overflow is permitted, and life controls are at least 44×44 CSS pixels. The four- and eight-player screenshots in [screenshots](screenshots/) were captured from the app and visually inspected. Small eight-player boards may scroll to retain usable controls.

## Measured response

See [performance.json](performance.json) for the machine-readable results. Twenty actions of each kind were measured in a 390×844 Chromium viewport against the development server on healthy loopback, with no CPU throttling:

| Measurement                                                                    |  Median | 95th percentile | Maximum |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------: | --------------: | ------: |
| Local programmatic input → next animation frame after displayed life change    | 14.1 ms |         14.5 ms | 14.5 ms |
| HTTP shared command → server commit → WebSocket display → next animation frame | 14.6 ms |         14.9 ms | 23.2 ms |

The shared measurement bypasses optimistic client commands and waits for the authoritative broadcast, so it includes request/commit/display latency. The local measurement measures immediate feedback, not IndexedDB durability. These observations meet the 100/300 ms targets on this host; they do **not** establish physical-phone or Wi-Fi performance. No prolonged physical-device thermal/battery measurement was possible.

## Reproduce

```sh
npm ci
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium webkit
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:pwa
npm run test:proxy
npm run test:lan
docker build -t mtg-util:local .
npm run test:container
```

The LAN smoke chooses a private IPv4 interface on this machine; set `LAN_HOST=192.168.1.50` if multiple interfaces require a choice. It does not send requests to unrelated machines. It starts and stops its own production server and in-memory database. The proxy and PWA checks also use isolated temporary servers. The container check removes only its own temporary containers/volume.

For performance, start `npm run dev` separately and run `npm run measure:performance`. It writes `docs/performance.json` and creates an ordinary test room with sample names in that server; normal room retention removes it later. Use `E2E_BASE_URL` to point the browser suite or measurement script at an alternate configured origin.

On this Arch-based development host, browser downloads were stored in ignored `.browser-cache/`, so the executed browser commands used `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=.browser-cache`. WebKit needed ICU 74, libxml2, and flite compatibility libraries; extracted copies were placed only in that local browser cache. No system package replacement was performed. A supported Ubuntu runner with `playwright install --with-deps` is the reproducible CI path. Ignore generated `playwright-report/`, `test-results/`, databases, and browser caches when sharing source.

For a direct Chromium `setOffline` check against an already-running production server, the optional command is:

```sh
E2E_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8081 E2E_PWA=1 \
  npm run test:e2e -- --project=chromium-phone tests/e2e/offline.spec.ts
```

`test:pwa` is the preferred full offline check and starts its own server. Architecture smoke and backup commands are in [deployment](deployment.md).

## Physical-device release checklist

These checks remain **unverified**. Use at least one iPhone in Safari and one representative Android phone in Chrome. Record device model, OS/browser version, tab versus installed mode, URL scheme, and date. Run ordinary tab flows first; installation is optional for users.

1. Open the exact configured LAN/HTTPS URL on both phones. Create a four-seat room, scan its QR with the other phone's normal camera, enter a display name, request and approve a seat. Verify the keyboard leaves confirmation buttons reachable and closing it restores layout.
2. Play with 2/4/6/8 seats in portrait and landscape. Check browser bars, notches, home indicators, scrollable eight-seat boards, long names, −999,999 life, rotated seats/upright sheets, and 200% zoom. On a shared tablet, hold or tap two different seats simultaneously and verify exact totals.
3. During a hold, release outside, scroll a sheet, open a modal, switch apps, open the camera, and lock/unlock the phone. Repeat with a shared connection lost mid-hold. No background or canceled repeat should continue. Shared input must pause until the current snapshot is verified.
4. Let the host phone sleep while another approved phone edits. Reopen the host, confirm identical totals, and confirm its host role has not moved. Drop Wi-Fi after a change; reconnect and check that the change appears exactly once. Verify the explicit independent local-copy path during an outage.
5. Export/download JSON and import through the phone's file picker and pasted text. Test a rejected/corrupt file without losing the current game. Confirm a guest cannot edit another seat unless the host enables that policy.
6. Over trusted HTTPS, wait for the production app's first successful load, then enable airplane mode and reopen the local game. Make an edit, reload again, and verify the saved value. Separately test Safari Add to Home Screen and Android installation; record whether each context shares or separates saved data. Accept an app update only after saving and confirm the game survives.
7. Use VoiceOver/TalkBack through setup, board, player details, commander lists, and dialogs. Check focus return, labels, batched hold announcements, contrast, and system reduced motion. Try optional wake lock, fullscreen, vibration, and audio; unsupported enhancements must leave play usable.
8. Play for at least 30 minutes on a modest phone with eight seats and repeated shared updates. Record response latency against the 100 ms local/300 ms healthy-LAN targets, memory trend, animation smoothness, warmth, battery usage, and background recovery. Repeat a short join/edit/resume smoke in Samsung Internet, iPhone Chrome, Firefox, and previous supported major browser versions when available.

Native ARM hardware/hosted runner results, physical screen-reader checks, real installed-mode behavior, current/previous mobile browser coverage, and prolonged battery/thermal checks must be added before claiming full device release validation.
